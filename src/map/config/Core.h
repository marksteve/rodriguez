//Uncomment to enable circular area checks.
//By default, all range checks in Aegis are of Square shapes, so a weapon range
//  of 10 allows you to attack from anywhere within a 21x21 area.
//Enabling this changes such checks to circular checks, which is more realistic,
//  but is not the official behaviour.
